Visual Analytics and Communication




In every problem, interpretation/analysis will be considered more important than the code. Submit a single .ipynb with the three problem solutions, datasets, links to github and dashboards before Friday 03/07/2025 11:59 pm.

Problem 1




Select one major airport from the U.S. East Coast (e.g., JFK, ATL, MIA, BOS, PHL). Using available flight route data:

Map all the direct routes from the selected airport.

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand popular routes, airport connectivity, and operations performance. Some suggested questions to guide your EDA include:

What are the top 5 destinations by number of flights?

How does flight volume vary by time of day or season?

What percentage of flights are domestic vs. international?

Are there any hubs with significant traffic connections?

What are the most frequent airlines operating from this airport?




Problem 2




An academic institution wants to monitor their admission process and students' satisfaction. Design a university dashboard that tracks student admissions, retention, and satisfaction. The data is in the file university_student_dashboard_data.csv. Consider the following aspects in your analysis:

Metrics & KPIs:

Total applications, admissions, and enrollments per term

Retention rate trends over time

Student satisfaction scores over the years

Enrollment breakdown by department (Engineering, Business, Arts, Science)

Comparison between Spring vs. Fall term trends.

Compare trends between departments, retention rates, and satisfaction levels.

Dashboard Implementation:

Create a prototype in Pyhon (streamlit cloud).

Ensure the dashboard provides insights on student trends over multiple years.

Provide key findings and actionable insights.

Problem 3




Find a real-world dataset from an open-source repository (e.g., Kaggle, Data.gov, UCI Machine Learning Repository, Open Data Portals). Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and create two visualizations for the same insight:

The WORST possible plot: A poorly designed visualization that misrepresents the data, is cluttered, lacks readability, or is misleading.

The IMPROVED version: A refined visualization that enhances clarity, conveys insight effectively, and follows best practices in visual analytics.

In this case, it is important to provide a short explanation comparing both visualizations.
